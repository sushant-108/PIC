A collection of experiments I have performed for the course "Programming in C" as part of the curriculum for Semester 1 of FY BTech. 
Note: I do not claim ownership of the codes. As I am uploading these files 1.5 years after completing the course, I don't have a record as to which codes I did by myself and which codes were copied from/inspired from other websites.
Mostly, websites like GeeksforGeeks, etc. has been referred to by me.
You may view the codes, but I'd advise you to not try to make money out of it, as I myself don't know from where I have taken the codes from as there is a time gap of 1.5 years between completing the experiments and making this repository.
I shall not be responsible for any untoward incident resulting from the use of the content in this repository.
You may continue viewing this repository keeping the above points in mind.
Thank you!
Hope this helps you with your coding assignments!!
